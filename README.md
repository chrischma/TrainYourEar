# TrainYourEar 0.9

TrainYourEar is a web app that - unsurprisingly - helps you to train your ear. I wrote this as my very first commisioned work for a german YouTube piano teacher named "Hans Liljekvist". 

It is written in pure and dirty javascript. It also was the very first time i worked with JavaScript, but nevertheless i am quite satisfied with the result. In addition to what i wrote from sketch, used LoadingBar.js (https://github.com/loadingio/loading-bar/).

Btw: The final app works with mp3 instead of wav.
