# TrainYourEar 1.0

TrainYourEar is a web app that - unsurprisingly - helps you to train your ear. I wrote this as my very first commisioned work for a german YouTube piano teacher named [Hans Liljekvist](https://www.youtube.com/user/blackbirdmusix).

It is written in pure and dirty javascript. It also was the very first time i worked with JavaScript, but nevertheless i am quite satisfied with the result. In addition to what i wrote from sketch, used LoadingBar.js (https://github.com/loadingio/loading-bar/).

If you are interested, check out this live-preview of the app:
